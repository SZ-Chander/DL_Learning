# DL_Learning
## Instruction
This is my Personal code repository for deep-learning study.I generally name the folders explicitly in two ways: xxx_Study and xxx_kai{}.<br>
The Study named folder is the code used in understanding the algorithms, which is generally a direct reference to open source code blocks on the internet basically except for the deep learning algorithm section, in most cases I will indicate the main source of the reference.<br>
The kai{} folder generally represents code of my own design, compared to the study code, these kai code will involve some optimization or algorithmic improvement. At the same time, the kai code rarely references blocks of code, and I will require that the code is one that I fully understand. The kai code directly represents my understanding of this study.<br>
Since the development environment of the repository is mostly from my Mac_OS device, some of the code may not run directly on Windows or Linux system. For example, I often use split method to cut the path directly, which is perfectly suitable for Mac_OS and Linux, but Windows will have problems because of the special path format. You can try to solve these problems by yourself, but you are welcome to submit an issue to share with me and make progress together, if you have an issue to submit, I will optimize it when I have time!
